    An iterable dataset that parses and yields tar files.
    This distributor handles the multi-aspect ratio case. For the dataloader to be successful,
    each worker should load only one aspect ratio. Else, there can be a batch where two
    aspect ratios would be present which would raise an error in collate function.
    So, we design data distribution strategy so that each worker sees only one aspect ratio.
