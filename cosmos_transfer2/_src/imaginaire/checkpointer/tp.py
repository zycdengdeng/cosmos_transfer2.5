    Checkpointer class for Tensor Parallelism (TP) in distributed training.

    This implementation supports the combination of Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Data Parallel Processing (DDP), with optional Context Parallelism (CP).

    - Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) is not supported by this checkpointer.
    - In principle, this implementation is also compatible with Pipeline Parallelism (PP) and Expert Parallelism (EP), which are other forms of model parallelism. However, PP and EP have not been tested yet.
